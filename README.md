This repository contains Fashion-ZSD dataset of the [Zero-Shot Object Detection by Hybrid Region Embedding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06157.pdf).

Fashion-ZSD is a toy dataset that we generate for evaluation of ZSD methods, based on the [Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset. Fashion-MNIST originally consists of Zalandoâ€™s article images with associated labels. This dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of size 28x28, and 10 classes.

For Zero-shot detection task, we split the dataset into two disjoint sets; seven classes are used in training and three classes are used as the unseen test classes.
